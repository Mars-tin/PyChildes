# @required: ['header', 'utterance', 'dependent']


# Headers (@)
# -----------
# A header is a line of text that gives information about the participants and the setting.
# All headers begin with the '@' sign.
# See Sec. 7 in https://talkbank.org/manuals/CHAT.html#_Toc176356502

  #   Default: false
  keep_data: false


# Utterances (*)
# -----------
# Lines beginning with * indicate what was actually said. These are called 'main lines.'
# Each main line/tier should code one and only one utterance.
# When a speaker produces several utterances in a row, code each with a new main line.
# The following arguments control the processing of main tiers.
