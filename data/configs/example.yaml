# @version: 1.1.0
# @description: Configuration schema for .cha processing pipeline
# @required: ['header', 'utterance', 'dependent']


# Headers (@)
# -----------
# A header is a line of text that gives information about the participants and the setting.
# All headers begin with the “@” sign.
# See Sec. 7 in https://talkbank.org/manuals/CHAT.html#_Toc176356502
header:

  # keep_data:
  # -----------
  # Controls header retention in output file
  #   Values (bool):
  #     true = keep headers
  #     false = remove headers
  #   Default: false
  keep_data: false


# Utterances (*)
# -----------
# Lines beginning with * indicate what was actually said. These are called “main lines.”
# Each main line/tier should code one and only one utterance.
# When a speaker produces several utterances in a row, code each with a new main line.
# The following arguments control the processing of main tiers.
utterance:

  # keep_data:
  # -----------
  # Controls utterance retention in output file.
  #   Values (bool):
  #     true = keep utterances
  #     false = remove utterances
  #   Default: true
  keep_data: true

  # keep_speaker:
  # -----------
  # Controls speaker token retention in output file.
  #   Refer To: Sec. 5.1.7
  #   Values (bool):
  #     true = keep speaker tokens
  #     false = remove speaker tokens
  #   Default: true
  keep_speaker: true

  # nonverbal:
  # -----------
  # Process the `0` symbol to mark cases where only one form is used.
  # In the main lines, it is usually used to indicate that there is an action but no speech.
  #   Refer To: Sec. 16.4
  #   Values (str): '<your_choice_of_silence_token>'
  #   Default: '<0>'
  nonverbal: '<0>'

  # incomplete:
  # -----------
  # Process the incomplete and omitted words.
  # In the main lines, words may also be incomplete or even fully omitted.
  #   Refer To: Sec. 8.6
  incomplete:

    # noncompletion:
    # -----------
    # When a word is incomplete, but the intended meaning seems clear,
    # insert the missing material within parentheses.
    #   Values (bool):
    #     true = keep complete form, remove parentheses
    #     false = keep incomplete form, remove parentheses and content within
    #   Default: true
    noncompletion: true

    # [TODO] omitted:
    # -----------
    # To code an omission, the `&=0` symbol is placed before a word/POS on the text tier.
    #   Values (bool):
    #     true = keep complete form, remove `&=0`
    #     false = keep incomplete form, remove `&=0` and word after
    #   Default: false
    omitted: false

  # unidentifiable:
  # -----------
  # Process the unidentifiable sound or group of sounds onto special tokens.
  #   Refer To: Sec. 8.4
  unidentifiable:

    # unintelligible:
    # -----------
    # Use the symbol `xxx` when you cannot hear or understand what the speaker is saying.
    #   Values (str): '<your_choice_of_unintelligible>'
    #   Default: '<unk>'
    unintelligible: '<unk>'

    # phonological:
    # -----------
    # Use the symbol `yyy` when all materials are phonologically coded on a `%pho` line.
    #   Values (str): '<your_choice_of_phonological>'
    #   Default: '<unk>'
    phonological: '<pho>'

    # untranscribed:
    # -----------
    # Use the symbol `www` when a transcriber does not know how to transcribe or does not want to transcribe.
    # This symbol must be used in conjunction with an `%exp` tier which is discussed
    # in the chapter on dependent tiers.
    #   Values (str): '<your_choice_of_untranscribed>'
    #   Default: '<unk>'
    untranscribed: '<unk>'

  # scoped:
  # -----------
  # Process the paralinguistic and duration scoping
  #   Refer To: Sec. 10.2
  scoped:

    # paralinguistic:
    # -----------
    # Paralinguistic events, such as coughing, laughing, or yelling can be marked by using square brackets,
    # the `=!` symbol, a space, and then text describing the event.
    #   Values (str): 'null' or '<your_choice_of_paralinguistic>'
    #   Default: 'evt' (angle brackets automatically apply if not null)
    paralinguistic: 'evt'

    # explanation:
    # -----------
    # The `=` symbol is used for brief explanations on the text tier.
    # This symbol is helpful for specifying the deictic identity of objects and people.
    #   Values (str): 'null' or '<your_choice_of_explanation>'
    #   Default: 'null' (angle brackets automatically apply if not null)
    explanation: 'null'

    # stressing:
    # -----------
    # [!] with accompanying angle brackets to indicate that the phrase is stressed
    # [!] without accompanying angle brackets to indicate that the pre­ceding word is stressed
    #   Values (str): 'null' or '<your_choice_of_stressing>'
    #   Default: 'stress' (angle brackets automatically apply if not null)
    stressing: 'stress'


# Dependent Tiers (%)
# -----------
# Dependent tiers are lines typed below the main line that contain
# codes, comments, events, and descriptions of interest to the researcher.
# All dependent tiers should begin with the percent symbol (%) and should be in lower­case letters.
# See Sec. 11 in https://talkbank.org/manuals/CHAT.html#_Toc176356556
dependent:

  # keep_data: Controls dependent tier retention in output file
  # -----------
  #   Values (bool):
  #     true = keep dependent tiers
  #     false = remove dependent tiers
  #   Default: true
  keep_data: false
